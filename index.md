##About Me
My name is Jonathan Glines. I am a C/C++ programmer with interests in computer
graphics, games, Japanese, and reading. If I ever had free time I would be
programming (honestly), reading, updating this website, or hiking.

This website is where I organize/dump the things I have worked on or am
currently working on. This might be considered a "blog" by some, but it's more
of a collection of tutorials for subjects that I am trying to understand, as
well as a portfolio of fun things I've done. Hopefully I can find the time to
try more things (I have a huge backlog).

##Site Map

###[Articles](./articles/index.html)
Articles, tutorials, and postmortems for problems I've worked on. Most of these
are articles for my own benefit, but if you find any of them helpful that's
even better. I try to make demos, example code, and printable PDF's along with
each article.

###[Productions](./productions/index.html)
A collection of projects and demos I have made.  Most of these are viewable in
any modern web browser, with more to come.

###[Blog](./blog/index.html)
This is where I will (eventually) write about personal things unrelated to
programming.
