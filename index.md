My name is Jonathan Glines. This website is just a place I use to organize/dump
the things I have worked on or am currently working on. This only comes after
the realization that I can hardly keep track of these things myself.

This might be considered a kind of "blog", but it's really just a collection of
tutorials for certain subjects that I'm trying to grasp, as well as a sort of
portfolio of fun things I've done.

##[Articles](./articles/index.html)
Articles, tutorials, and postmortems that I've written concerning problems I've
worked on. Most of these are written for my own benefit, but if any of these
articles help others that's even better. Most of these articles have demos,
example code, and printable PDF's. Each article is kind of like a
programming blog post, except I reserve the right to revise them
whenever my understanding of the topic changes.

##[Productions](./demos/index.html)
A collection of some of the (mostly graphics) demos that I have come up with.
Most of these that aren't compiled should be viewable in any modern web
browser.

##[Blog](./blog/index.html)
This is where I write about personal things that are (usually) unrelated to
graphics or programming.
