# Lazy Gaze Mouse Control

I'm not sure exactly what this mouse technique is called, but it's used in
[Nvidia's bubble demo](http://www.nvidia.com/coolstuff/demos#!/bubble), among
other things. I'm calling it the "lazy gaze" control scheme. It's useful for
situations where things like demos or web pages, where Arcball control or
mouse capturing are overkill.
