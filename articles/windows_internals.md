% Windows Internals Experiments

I'm using this page to document my progress reading this book. This is similar
to how I'm documenting my progress reading [TAOCP](./taocp.html).

I'm using the sixth edition at the moment, which is written for Windows 7. Some
of the experiments I have run on Windows 7, but most of them I've run on
Windows 10. If I find an experiment that does not seem to run on Windows 10, I
will make note of it.

## Chapter 1: Concepts and Tools
