\subsection{1.2.3 Sums and Products}
\subsubsection*{Exercise 1 Solution}
%The text says that $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_0 = 0$. What, then, is $a_2 + \cdots + a_0$?
\begin{align*}
a_2 + \cdots + a_0 = a_2 + a_1 + a_0 = -a_1
\end{align*}
For a second I thought this exercise was a typo, but considering how many
people must be reviewing this book a typo here is pretty unlikely. This is just
a very silly use of ellipses.
%\subsubsection*{Notes}
%Something about a graphic depicting interchanging order of summation.
