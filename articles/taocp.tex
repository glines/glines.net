\title{My Solutions to Exercises from TAOCP}
\begin{document}

I've kept a copy of Donald Knuth's [The Art of Computer
Programming](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html) on my
top shelf for a couple of years now. It's the third edition box set, complete with
TeX typesetting and beautiful Computer Modern typefaces. I occasionally flip
through it randomly just to admire the print. I've also referenced TAOCP from
time to time for things like sorting algorithms and binary heaps. But I
initially bought TAOCP to study at my leisure rather than as a reference.


One of the suggestions in the preface to Volume 1 is to work all of the
recommended exercises. The problem I have is that it's difficult to keep myself
honest and actually do the exercises without skipping them, so to that end I
decided to post my solutions (and my progress) here. Some of my solutions are
probably incomplete, copied from the back, or just plain wrong. I try to make
notes where I can of my thought process while solving these exercises, for my
own benefit. I also make notes where I think my solution is dubious or
incorrect.

I know that all of these solutions are given in the back of the book. The
solutions given here are for my own benefit. Any help they might be to
others is purely incidental.

Feedback on any of my solutions is very welcome.
